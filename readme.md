# Grouper
A DSL written for organizers of group projects to help create the best possible groups for all participants. Designed to have a simple syntax to specify participants by their interests, experience, desired positions, etc. in the hope of solving the problem of bad groups for projects. Grouper depends on Python3, pypeg2, and python-constraint, all of which can be installed with pip3.

##Example Programs
Three example programs can be found in the folder _ExamplePrograms_. These can be run by following these steps:

`git clone https://github.com/robinspollak/Grouper.git`

`python3 engine.py text-program1.txt`
